Web Application for CUNY transfer Students, Collaborative Project.  

For now  the current web page is on my venus account .   WILL NOT REFLECT ANY CHANGES IMEDIATELY. 

https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~vima9953/

We can decide to host it elsewhere (heroku?) later on, but for now this will do. 

# Backend information 
## Make good comments when commiting changes to backend code.
We are using Express, a node framework for back end. 

### in App.js fill in our database ip address. IDK how to make it so it is not viewable to the whole world.  
 open the package.json file to see which packages you need to npm install. 
 They are under dependencies. 
 
 Check if its working, by running node app.js    (check port 3000 on browser)
 
 
 
 Views folder contains the html as ejs(embedded java script)  files for express to render them. 
 folder public contains the css.  WE allow express to serve this in app.js file. Read comments.
